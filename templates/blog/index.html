    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        This is my "portfolio" site to try and represent some of my "skills" working with (primarily) python.
    </p>

    <p>
        The entire page is written in Python, HTML and CSS. I wrote the whole thing character by character myself and have not copied and paste anything that I didnt come up with myself.
